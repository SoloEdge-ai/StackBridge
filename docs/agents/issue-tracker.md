# Issue tracker: GitHub

Issues and PRDs for this repo live as GitHub issues in `SoloEdge-ai/StackBridge`. Use the `gh` CLI for all operations.

## Conventions

- **Create an issue**: `gh issue create --title "..." --body "..."`.
- **Read an issue**: `gh issue view <number> --comments` and fetch its labels.
- **List issues**: `gh issue list --state open --json number,title,body,labels,comments` with appropriate label and state filters.
- **Comment on an issue**: `gh issue comment <number> --body "..."`.
- **Apply or remove labels**: `gh issue edit <number> --add-label "..."` or `--remove-label "..."`.
- **Close an issue**: `gh issue close <number> --comment "..."`.

Infer the repository from `git remote -v`; `gh` does this automatically inside the clone.

## Pull requests as a triage surface

**PRs as a request surface: no.** Set this to `yes` only if the project later treats external pull requests as feature requests.

GitHub shares one number space across issues and pull requests. Resolve an ambiguous `#42` with `gh pr view 42`, then fall back to `gh issue view 42`.

## Skill operations

- When a skill says to publish to the issue tracker, create a GitHub issue.
- When a skill says to fetch a ticket, run `gh issue view <number> --comments`.
- Wayfinding maps use a `wayfinder:map` issue with linked child issues and native dependency edges when available.
